Driving across lagos, it's obvious in observvation that a major number of the churches use tent buildings to host their congregration, this lean 
methodology works in scaling expecially if the church is planning on moving to a permanent building which is larger, or if they intend to expand their structure based on demand.

However contrary to how Solomon built the Temple in the bible, this is not [right], When solomon built the temple of God and offered sacrifice [benefits]
The symbolism of the sand, stone and concrete is deep in thelogy and spiritual realm, man was made from the sand () building the church from the rule[thesarus] of the altar. 
Jacob, Isaac, david etc gathered stones to form an altar for God.

However, you can tell that most of these decisions are driven by budget, but it is very important to note that as Christains we walk by faith and not by sight, take for example DUNAMIS CHURCH that built what he did and was criticized largely, this is because of a lot of people do not understand the dynamics of offering the lord a building of his own, build your house on the rock, as much as this goes, it goes on to show a sign of utmost respect and not only does it do so, 
It's a living legacy, a way of telling God It's all about you and less of me, more importantly I want this legacy to live.
When a house is fallen, it can be rebuilt (Nehemiah) built the temple of God, When a Tent is fallen, who rebuilds it ?

Build your house on the rock, Build the Church of God on the Rock, Once you take the step towards it, God makes it come to pass.
