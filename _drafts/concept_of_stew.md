Stew is everywhere, bachelors love stew, while growing up my uncle gave me an age old knowledge about the Stew, he said to me 
Andrew, growing up as a bachelor some of the things that will be most important to  you will be career and personal growth, most times you may not have the convenience for chores, laundry etc. and more importantly cooking, so whenever you do have the time, embrace the stew.

What this means is that during the weekend if you prepare stew, you would most evidently not be hungry, over the week, why ?

With stew you can combine hot water and make 

- Stew +  rice
- You can east spaghetti, macaroni, etc
- You can eat plantain, yam, potatoe
- You can eat beans

Practically naming, the stew is a lifesaver, however these days has come to mean a lot of things, including pepper and salt

I hope with time the concept[thesarus] of the stew still remains, if you have something you can conveniently combine with the stew let me know.

So In your business what can be your stew, the one factor that can help you retain customers, provide value,or scale with [RESEARCH CIR], this can help you acquire customers with very minimal cost of acquisition while making a once in a period investment in the stew. 

So we can look at it in several areas which could include:
