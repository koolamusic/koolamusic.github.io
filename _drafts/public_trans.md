The Rules of Public Transportation in Lagos.

I recently lost my phone in a Danfo while commuting from Obalende to Ajah, on a Friday night, while I recall many of the activities leading to the incident, 
I still can't figure what moment it happened.

However i spoke to some people about it, and as someone new to working in the city of lagos they told me, welcome to lagos, these are the rules of transporting, Rotolo
[linkedIn] gave the benefit of mentioning some of the rules to abide in public transportation. 

In his words, 


- Dey G
Keep your senses at the top, observe every action, movement, and communication as they occur. I once had a man


- All that glitters is not gold
Don't trust any bus that has a good exterior, well painted, seats with foam, looking all polished, you possibly might be falling for a trap, or a rookie driver who would either waste your precious time or get everyone in trouble, or the vehicle won't even reach your final destination because its engine isnt good.
Its more like user interface without logic.


- Identify the frequency of drops and pickups
Sometimes they work with their fellows and spread across junctions and pickup points, choose a side of the vehicle that would be easy for you to alight from, but keep your eyes open for eye contact between those dropping and the new passengers entering, or even between the new passengers entering and those already in the bus, to identify whether there's about to be a ruse, just come down from the bus immediately if you are not feeling comfortable, and look for a way to enter a new vehicle. especially if the distance to where you are going to is a long one, that could require more than 30 minutes en route with no traffic

- Two things you must do to yourself 
Search yourself before you enter, and search yourself after you alight the bus, just by the vehicle door.



But as the days go by, I quickly cannot forget the word `DEY G` as I enter every new public transport, hopefully abiding by the principles of `G` would enable you 
leave the vehicle smarter, better and without any loss.

This list is not in anyway exaustive, but if you have experience with any rules that would help commuters stay safer while using pub trans, dont mind sharing.
