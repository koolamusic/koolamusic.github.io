<p>I am Andrew, a Full-stack Software Engineer with a solid background in Mobile and Web Landscapes, an Agile and SCRUM Project Master, Software Architect, Design Creative and Founder of Tecmie, a platforms solution architect for small and enterprise organizations including Education, Business, Retail and Government.</p>
Our strengths are in helping Startups prototype, test and launch their MVP with a clear growth and development strategy on their Tech and Design.

 
Aside that, I mentor and teach music, programming in online communities and at <a href="https://tet.tecmie.com">TETA</a>, a Training Program for CTOs.


Most of my years after schools has been spent on sudying the tech startup ecosystem, learning to write softwares for the web, I love the web and how it has come to grow recently, I love opensource and try to contribute to open source software in any way I can, recently with a knack for softwares pioneering growth of midi interfaces over the web and pragmatic solutions for distribution of learning media resource in music over the years. 

I believe in continous improvement, constantly learning to thrive and contribute to my communities, I am a die hard at something i set my mind on. Excellence is the utmost aim, I fear sometimes that staying at the top is hard when you get there, but why don't we get there and worry about the former later.

In past two years I have consistently absorbed myself into learning ecosystems, that push further beyond technology, business, and people development, I personally have a very strong desire and passion to build technology solutions, and I believe in the depth of knowledge available on the internet.

I live the Life of a dreamer, create immersive experiences with music and technology and try to always stay happy and positive Sometimes it looks like i have a crazy lifestyle, but I am proud of everything that I am and will become.

<p>I've written a blog since 2012 <a href="http://topinfoz.blogspot.com/">See my earliest Editions</a>. . Unsurprisingly, over the years what I've written about has changed, reflecting whatever I've been interested in at the time. Sometimes I'll write about something that just grabs my attention, other times I may make a lot of reference to food, since my friends at <a href="https://twitter.com/LearnFactoryNG">LearnFactory</a> has adorned me with the title 'Food for Africa' <blockquote>Hopefully I would solve the hunger problem of rural communities in Africa</blockquote>. I'll maintain this website as my personal journal from now on</p>

<p>This site is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static site</a> generator, and hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, who specialise in hosting static sites. Netlify connects to Git (well, Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket), which means that when I push a change to my repo, the website is updated. This is a very good way to work. I recommend Netlify &#8212; they also offer forms, redirects and even AWS services integration.</p>

<p>I use a Jekyll &#8220;framework&#8221; called <a href="https://github.com/leonp/jekyll-tachyons">Jekyll Tachyons</a>, as it makes building a Jekyll site on the <a href="http://tachyons.io">Tachyons CSS framework</a> quick and easy. I like <span role="img" aria-label="lightning fast">⚡️</span>.</p>
